# radius_restserver
REST Endpoint for FreeRadius Server

![build status](https://codeship.com/projects/f21c2f30-a7c1-0133-1520-721682b6b155/status?branch=master)

This includes a (very insecure) FreeRADIUS 2.0 server and a Django app for accessing RADIUS data.
We're hoping this will one day be a replacement for ARA.

This is designed to be built with docker-compose

something likeâ€¦

```
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose run --rm radius /usr/src/build/load-test-data.sh
```

You probably want to use `docker-compose logs` a lot.

The web app is exposed on port 81 in docker-compose. We develop with docker-machine and this works nicely.

Once you've started the app, a few housekeeping things are needed

```
docker-compose run --rm django ./manage.py migrate
docker-compose run --rm django ./manage.py createsuperuser
#if you want to load the test data - recommended
docker-compose run --rm radius /usr/src/build/load-test-data.sh
```
